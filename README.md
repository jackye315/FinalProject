Battleship

January 5, 2015
We will be making a Battleship game using processing. We're using a 2D array to setup the board and the coordinates of the ships will be random. The player will play against an AI. First the player will go, then the AI will go similar to the move system in Stuyablo. There will be a method for shooting a specific coordinate on the grid, where the player can choose the coordinates and the AI will shoot at random. The AI will shoot randomly until it hits a ship, in which it will then proceed to hit around the ship until it lands a second hit. Once the second hit is landed, it will follow that sequence. The game will end when either the player's or AI's ships are all destroyed.

Methods:
Shooting method-two parameters, the two coordinates
Setup -sets up grid
AIplay-how the AI will play, using shooting method and random parameters
ShowGrid-shows if shooting hit a ship
PlayGame-Method for playing where one player starts then the other

We downloaded Processing and spent the period trying to open/run it.

January 7,2015
We got processing to run and made the initial grid. We also discussed more about the game mechanics and started working on the attack method with mouse
